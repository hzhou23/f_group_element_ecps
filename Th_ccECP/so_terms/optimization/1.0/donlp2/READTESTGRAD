In order to run testgrad_dyn.c you must remove the "main" from the example files
and also the directive #include "o8para.h". then make a 
cat testgrad_dyn.c example.c > lauf.c 
and gcc -oexe lauf.c -lc -lm
input for testgrad_dyn.c is prompted. use standard c input format
of course, if you decide to give an x other than the one given
in user_init then it must be senseful for your case.
in the input questions answer 0 is "no" and "1" is yes.
if you have already used one test and answer with "0" 
the question "input of x desired" then the run is finished.
results are in testgrad.res and it is at your disposition whether 
to tolerate the errors reported there or not. a typical choice might be 
1.0e-8 for "stepsize for num. diff."  and 1.0e-7 for feasible error 
tolerance. (the simple forward difference quotient is used)
If you have an evaluation in bloc mode, then you must 
perform a bloc call yourself inside artificial made subprograms 
and store the values from fu and fugrad in the corresponding variables
(i.e. you _must_ write some ef, egradf, econ, 
econgrad with this functionality)
